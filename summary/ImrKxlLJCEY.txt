Journalist asks: You've avoided a recession. Why not cut the rates now?
Powell answers: With the economy strong, we want to see more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2% before we begin to reduce interest rates.

Journalist asks: Why is your target rate 2%?
Powell answers: Interest rates always include an estimate of future inflation. If that estimate is 2%, the central bank will have more power to fight a downturn.

Journalist asks: Are you committed to getting all the way to 2.0 before you cut the rates?
Powell answers: No, we're committed to returning inflation to 2% over time. We wouldn't wait to get to 2% to cut rates.

Journalist asks: Was the Fed too slow to recognize inflation in 2021?
Powell answers: In hindsight, it would have been better to have tightened policy earlier. We thought the economy would fix itself quickly, but we pivoted and started tightening when it became clear that inflation was not transitory.

Journalist asks: How would you characterize the consensus around this table for rate cuts?
Powell answers: Almost all of the 19 participants believe it will be appropriate to cut the federal funds rate this year.

Journalist asks: How do you assess the national debt?
Powell answers: The U.S. federal government is on an unsustainable fiscal path, and it's time for us to get back to putting a priority on fiscal sustainability.

Journalist asks: Your decisions inevitably are going to have a bearing on this year's election. To what degree does politics determine your timing?
Powell answers: We do not consider politics in our decisions. Integrity is priceless, and we plan on keeping ours.
